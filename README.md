# locus
locus generates a desktop theme based on the colours in your current wallpaper. It includes themes for Plasma and Aurorae, a colorscheme and a QtCurve preset.

##Installation
Simply run `./dumb_installer.sh` in a terminal from this directory. It will copy all assets into place and automagically set the window decoration and desktop theme. You will need to set colors and QtCurve from SystemSettings.

### Installation Issues
Depending on your distro you may need to add ~/.local/bin to your PATH.
